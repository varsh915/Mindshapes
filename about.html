<h1>About Me – Mindshapes</h1>
<p><strong>Hi, I’m Varshini — currently 15 years old.</strong></p>
<p>Writing became more than just a hobby for me after 8th grade, when a prize for my first story sparked something I’d never felt before — a rush of adrenaline, and a will to keep going. Since then, I’ve found my voice in <strong>poetry and philosophy</strong>. Over the past two months, I’ve written over 25 poems, many of them born from sudden moments of inspiration — pouring thoughts into words when nothing else made sense.</p>
<p>I’ve always enjoyed <strong>aptitude-based olympiads</strong>, especially the ones introduced to me in 4th grade. I still remember being selected for the <strong>second level of the Unified Cyber Olympiad</strong> that year — one of my earliest moments of confidence in logical thinking. That curiosity has stayed with me and quietly shaped how I learn.</p>
<p>Reading is something I return to often — whether it's a novel that transports me or a non-fiction book that sharpens my thoughts. I’m also an ardent <strong>sports enthusiast</strong>, and <strong>watching tennis</strong> gives me a strange but real surge of motivation — something about the precision, the grit, the solitude.</p>
<p>I have a deep interest in <strong>geopolitics and debate</strong>, and I’ve participated in multiple <strong>Model United Nations</strong> and <strong>Youth Parliaments</strong>, earning awards like <strong>High Commendation in the UNSC</strong>. These experiences taught me not just how to argue — but how to listen, think deeper, and see multiple sides of a story.</p>
<p>I’ve had a keen interest in <strong>Deutsch (German)</strong> since 6th grade and have attended several <strong>Goethe-Institut workshops</strong>. In 9th grade, I earned an <strong>A1 level certificate</strong>, and I continue to learn German with curiosity and joy. I also enjoy <strong>learning new English vocabulary</strong> because it’s a language that keeps me constantly engaged — with new words, expressions, and nuances that never fail to interest me.</p>
<p>After 10th grade, I realized how much I genuinely love <strong>Physics and Mathematics</strong> — not just the formulas, but the logic, the reasoning, the questions behind the answers. That’s when I began preparing for the <strong>JEE</strong>, shifting my mindset from memorization to <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve also been coding in <strong>Python</strong> since 6th grade and still explore it in my free time — sometimes for fun, sometimes for structure. Whether it's a game, a puzzle, or just a curiosity, I enjoy the language of code just as much as the rhythm of poetry.</p>
<p><strong>Mindshapes</strong> is a space where I try to bring all of this together — my thoughts, my questions, my attempts, and the way I see the world.</p>
<p>It’s not perfect — just real. Like me.</p>
